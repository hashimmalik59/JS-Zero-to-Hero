// Challenge #2 BMI with if / else Statements

/* CHALLENGE #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

👋 OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture

IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2). */

const massMark = 85;
const heightMark = 1.88;
const massJohn = 95;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn);

/* Write your code below. Good luck! 🙂 */

if (BMIJohn > BMIMark) {
    console.log(`Mark BMI ${BMIMark} is higher than John's ${BMIJohn}`);
} else{
    console.log(`John's BMI ${BMIJohn} is higher than Mark's ${BMIMark}`);
}
